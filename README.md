# Wireless-Message-Communication
This project demonstrates a simple wireless communication system using a Bluetooth module, an LED, a pushbutton, and a feedback mechanism displayed on the Serial Monitor. When the pushbutton is pressed, a message is sent via Bluetooth, the LED toggles its state, and the status is displayed on the Serial Monitor.
